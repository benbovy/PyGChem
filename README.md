PyGChem
=======

**Important note: PyGChem is not maintained anymore. Alternatively, for
reading bpch files using the Python scientific stack you might have a look
at [xbpch](https://github.com/darothen/xbpch), which is more up-to-date and
uses [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/).**

PyGChem is a high-level, user-friendly Python interface to the
GEOS-Chem Model, a global 3-D chemical transport model (CTM)
for atmospheric composition.
